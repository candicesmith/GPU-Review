# GPU-Review
A review web app for graphics cards. This was an assignment for 2703ICT Web Application Development at Griffith University. The task was to create a web app for product reviews, where a user can register for an account and review the products listed in the database. I chose to use graphics cards as my product to review because I wanted to learn a bit more about them in general. The users create new products, review products, like other reviews and follow other users. It uses PHP with Laravel and a Model-View-Controller design pattern.
